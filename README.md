Hi, Iâ€™m Philip--you can call me Fips.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in offensive cybersecurity and writing robust software. Below is a non-exhaustive list of my current interests or fields I would like to explore:

- Cryptography and cryptanalysis
- Software exploitation and reverse engineering
- Automated program analysis and formal verification (via tools like SMT solvers)
- Mathematics, particularly in algebra (elliptic curves are cool)
- Consensus algorithms and scalable blockchains
- Cybersecurity-adjacent machine learning
- Cybersecurity-adjacent software engineering
- Compilers (optimizations, infrastructure)
- Arithmetic circuits and zero-knowledge proofs

- ðŸ“« Reach out to me on Twitter: @pwang00, and check out my [website](https://pwang00.github.io/) to learn more about me.
